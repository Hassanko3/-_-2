## Introduction

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of the market. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is particularly effective for this type of time series analysis because it can learn and remember patterns over time. This project applies LSTM to predict Apple's stock prices using historical data.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/apple-stock-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd apple-stock-price-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells to see the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction steps.

## Project Structure

- **apple_stock_prediction.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

## Results

The model is trained on Apple's historical stock data and predicts future prices. The notebook includes visualizations to compare the predicted stock prices with the actual prices, helping to assess the model's performance.
